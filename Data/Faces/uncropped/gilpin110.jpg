			<h2>African-American Adolescents and Depression</h2>
			 
		 	<p>Black adolescents express depressive symptoms differently than people from other age and racial groups, according to a new study, and clinicians need to take that into account when they develop a treatment plan.</p>
<p>The study was led by a researcher from Rutgers University-Camden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adolescent depression is a dire public concern in the United States, and even greater concern among Black adolescents, where, if left untreated, can disproportionately lead to an escalation of various mental disorders, academic failure, and related issues,&#8221; said Wenhua Lu, an assistant professor of childhood studies.</p>
<p>Lu and fellow researchers Michael Lindsey of New York University, Sireen Irsheild of the University of Chicago, and Von Eugene Nebbitt of Washington University examined the conceptualization of depression among Black adolescents and make recommendations for improving treatment in the study, &#8220;Psychometric Properties of the CES-D Among Black Adolescents in Public Housing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The findings were published in the November 2017 issue of the <em>Journal of the Society for Social Work</em> <em>and Research</em>.</p>
<p>According to a news release from Rutgers, Black adolescents who have depressive symptoms tend to express their feelings by complaining about conflicts with others and physical pains.</p>
<p>&#8220;When assessing and treating Black adolescents&#8217; depression, clinicians need to pay particular attention to their complaints about interpersonal struggles and physical discomfort,&#8221; Lu said. &#8220;Treatments such as interpersonal psychotherapy may work better for this population.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers note the great significance of determining these depressive symptoms among Black adolescents. Previous studies, they explain, have shown that Black adolescents who live in disadvantaged community environments &#8211; for example, urban public housing &#8211; are more likely to experience elevated levels of substance abuse, violence, and poverty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black adolescents who are exposed to such environmental and social risk factors without sufficient social-support networks are at a higher risk of depression,&#8221; says Lu.</p>
<p>Furthermore, say the researchers, youth who have been diagnosed with depression are six times more likely to commit suicide than their peers, and Black youth have a much higher suicide rate than their White peers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is imperative, therefore, to identify the unique ways Black adolescents express depressive symptoms, and calibrate existing assessment tools to improve their psychometric property for this population,&#8221; the researchers write in the study.</p>
<p>A total of 792 Black adolescents, ages 11 to 21, who lived in nine public housing developments in four major U.S. cities participated in the study. Adolescents completed a survey that contained a mixture of 20 negatively and positively worded items &#8211; such as such as &#8220;I felt sad,&#8221; &#8220;I enjoyed life,&#8221; &#8220;My appetite was poor,&#8221; and &#8220;People are unfriendly to me&#8221; &#8211; in the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).</p>
<p>The CES-D is a commonly used self-report tool to assess depressive symptoms in community-based populations. &#8220;However, this scale was developed primarily to assess clinical depression among White adults,&#8221; Lu said. &#8220;It has not been fully validated as a screening tool in Black adolescents.&#8221;</p>
		
		   		
			<h2>Do You Really Need A Hip Replacement?</h2>
			 
		 	<p>If your hips hurt, every position is uncomfortable. Sitting or standing, walking or even lying down—nothing gives you relief. These joints sit near your core and are essential to so much of our movement. No wonder 2.5 million Americans are living with total hip replacements, according to Mayo Clinic research.</p>
<p>However, there may be an alternative.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that hip replacements can be the best solution for some people, says Dr. Derek Ochai of the Nirschi Orthopaedic Center, in Arlington, Virginia: “Hip replacement is replacing the entire hip joint with metal and plastic parts. This is major surgery. [But] if you have debilitating pain from hip arthritis, this can be a life-changing positive surgery.”</p>
<p>Medical advances have made hip replacement increasingly common for people at younger ages. These new joints are more durable than older varieties when the surgery was first invented back in the 70s, and hospital stays have gotten shorter and shorter. The number of people choosing hip replacements doubled between 2000 and 2010.</p>
<p>But is there a way to avoid needing new joints in the first place? “The number-one thing people can do to decrease/avoid hip degeneration is to keep their weight down,” Ochai says. For instance, pressure on the hip with stair climbing is four to six times your body weight, so even minimal increases or decreases in body weight can have either a negative or positive effect.”</p>
<p>Another important move is to pay attention to how your hips feel during activities. If you start getting some pain during running, for example, Ochai suggests making changes to stride length or foot impact to put less pressure on the hips. “People can also switch from just doing one type of activity to cross training, to vary the pressure on their hips. In general, stationary bikes, elliptical trainers, in-line skating, and swimming put far less pressure on the hip joint than running.”</p>
<p>Osteoarthritis pain—that’s when the cartilage has broken down and bones start rubbing against each other—can start small, and lifestyle changes are crucial at that stage, especially when considering the cost of total hip replacement. In Los Angeles alone, the procedure ranges from $17,000 to $40,000. Blue Cross of North Carolina says the cost is between $32,000 and $44,000 for the surgery. Yet despite the expense, more than 90% of those who get a hip replacement say they are glad they did it and wish they had done it sooner.</p>
<p>But there is another option: Ochai and others offer an early intervention surgery called hip arthroscopy that can delay or even prevent the need for something as drastic as a total hip replacement. Arthroscopy means looking inside a joint through a small incision: Instead of taking out the whole joint, work can be done just on the parts that need it.</p>
<p>“Arthroscopic surgery can treat conditions that can potentially lead to arthritis,” Ochai says. “That is why if you are having pain in your hip, it would be important to get evaluated before your hip progresses to arthritis, since arthroscopic surgery can sometimes cure the condition that can lead to arthritis. Then replacement would not be necessary.”</p>
<p>“Many professional athletes have hip arthroscopy, and return to that sport. Hip arthroscopy is certainly not as common as hip replacement, and the number of surgeons expert at hip preservation arthroscopy is far fewer than with hip replacement.” The costs for this minimally invasive surgery are far less than hip replacement, under $10,000 and often even lower, and rarely does a patient even spend the night in the hospital.</p>
<p>The bottom line: If you want to avoid major surgery, you have to pay attention to your body and the first signs of joint distress. Early treatment and intervention give you options like hip arthroscopy. If you wait till the damage is done, you may have to turn to a more costly and dramatic procedure.</p>
		
		   		
			<h2>Protecting Your Family Against Carbon Monoxide</h2>
			 
		 	<p><em>Carbon monoxide, a colorless, odorless gas, can be deadly. The experts at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) share strategies on how to avoid it:</em></p>
<p>With more frigid weather on the way, it is important to stay safe while staying warm. Carbon monoxide (CO), produced by furnaces, vehicles, portable generators, stoves, lanterns, gas ranges, or burning wood can make you sick and even be life threatening. Protect yourself by taking the following simple steps:
<ul>
<li>Install a battery-operated or battery back-up CO detector in your home. Check or replace the battery when you change the time on your clocks each Spring and Fall.</li>
<li>Leave your home immediately and call 911 if your CO detector alarm sounds.</li>
<li>Have your heating system, water heater, and any other gas, oil, or coal burning appliances serviced by a qualified technician every year.</li>
<li>Seek prompt medical attention if you feel dizzy, light-headed, or nauseated and suspect CO poisoning.</li>
<li>Do not heat your house with a gas oven.</li>
<li>Never run a car or truck inside a garage attached to your house, even if you leave the door open.</li>
<li>Do not burn anything in a stove or fireplace that is not vented.</li>
<li>If your power goes out, remember—never use a generator, charcoal grill, camp stove, or other gasoline- or charcoal-burning device inside your home, basement, or garage or outside less than 20 feet from a window, door, or vent.</li>
</ul>

			<h2>Experts Call for World Health Organization to Rethink “Unacceptable” Plan for Older People</h2>
			 
		 	<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has been accused of &#8220;washing its hands of older people&#8221; in its proposed priorities for future work.</p>
<p>In a letter published online in January 2018 in <em>The Lancet</em>, experts on ageing from the University of East Anglia (UEA) and the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) say the draft WHO 13th General Programme of Work makes no reference to older people or to conditions associated with later life, such as dementia.</p>
<p>A release from the university notes that this is despite people aged 60 or over making up more than 12 per cent of the world&#8217;s population, a figure that will rise to 16.5 per cent by 2030. In less developed regions, they will make up 10 per cent of the population by 2030.</p>
<p>The General Programme of Work sets out the strategic vision for the activities of WHO, with the 12th and current one ending in 2019. It defines the key health areas where WHO aims to shape global health co-operation.</p>
<p>Peter Lloyd-Sherlock, professor of social policy and international development at UEA&#8217;s School of International Development, said: &#8220;Older people account for a much greater proportion of the global burden of disease and of need for health care than do other age groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is part of a wider pattern of explicit discrimination against older people in global health policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Setting out their concerns Prof Lloyd-Sherlock and co-authors Prof Shah Ebrahim and Prof Martin McKee, from the LSHTM, add: &#8220;Over the past decade, WHO has begun to address this key global challenge, yet the proposed WHO 13th General Programme of Work makes no reference to older people or to conditions associated with later life.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is entirely unacceptable. If the proposed Programme is approved, it will considerably diminish WHO&#8217;s global authority and will brand it as a champion of age discrimination.</p>
<p>&#8220;We therefore urge that WHO rectify this striking oversight and that the proposed Programme include substantial plans relating to the health of older people and challenges of population ageing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last November the draft 13th General Programme of Work was considered by WHO&#8217;s Executive Board. This month the Executive Board is due to further consider and submit the Programme to the World Health Assembly, which takes place in May.</p>
		
		   		
			<h2>Long-Distance Caregiving: Dealing with Frustration and Guilt</h2>
			 
		 	<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;"> <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Caregiving, especially from a distance, is likely to bring out many different emotions. Feeling frustrated and angry with everyone, from the care recipient to the doctors, is a common experience. Anger could be a sign that you are overwhelmed or that you are trying to do too much. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Although they may not feel as physically exhausted and drained as the primary, hands-on caregiver, long-distance caregivers may still be worried and anxious. Sometimes, long-distance caregivers feel guilty about not being closer, not doing enough, not having enough time with the person, and perhaps even feeling jealous of those who do. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Many long-distance caregivers also find that worrying about being able to afford to take time off from work, being away from family, or the cost of travel increases these frustrations. Remember that you are doing the best you can given the circumstances and that you can only do what you can do. It may help to know that these are feelings shared by many other long-distance caregivers—you are not alone in this.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">If you can, give yourself a break: take a walk, talk with your friends, get some sleep—try to do something for yourself.</span></p>

			<h2>Girls&#8217; Social Camouflage Skills May Delay or Prevent Autism Diagnosis</h2>
			 
		 	<p>On parent-reporting measures, girls with autism seem to struggle more than boys with performing routine tasks like getting up and dressed or making small talk, even when the study group is normalized to meet similar basic clinical diagnostic criteria across sexes. The findings add to the growing evidence that girls with autism may show symptoms differently than boys, and that some of the social difficulties experienced by females with autism may be masked during clinical assessments.</p>
<p>The study, led by researchers from the Center for Autism Spectrum Disorders at Children&#8217;s National Health System, was published in the <em>Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders</em> in January 2018.</p>
<p>A release from the Children&#8217;s National Health System quotes Allison Ratto, Ph.D<u>,</u> lead author of the study and a clinical psychologist within the Center for Autism Spectrum Disorders at Children&#8217;s National, as sayinh &#8220;Based on our research criteria, parents report that the girls in our study with autism seem to have a more difficult time with day-to-day skills than the boys. This could mean that girls who meet the same clinical criteria as boys actually are more severely affected by ongoing social and adaptive skill deficits that we don&#8217;t capture in current clinical measures, and that autistic girls, in general, may be camouflaging these types of autism deficits during direct assessments.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study used an age-and IQ-matched sample of school-aged youth diagnosed with ASD to assess sex differences according to the standard clinical tests including the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), as well as parent reported autistic traits and adaptive skills.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study is one of the first to eliminate many of the variables that obscure how sex impacts presentation of autism traits and symptoms. Though today&#8217;s clinical tools do a really good job capturing boys at a young age, with a wide range of symptom severity, they do it less effectively for girls,&#8221; adds Lauren Kenworthy, Ph.D.<u>,</u> director of the Center for Autism Spectrum Disorders, and another study contributor. &#8220;This is a crucial issue considering how much we know about the success of early interventions on long-term outcomes. We have to find better ways to identify girls with autism so we can ensure the best approaches reach all who need them as early as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Specific evidence of women more effectively masking or camouflaging social and communication deficits is limited, but autistic self-advocates theorize that the unique social pressures and demands on girls at a young age may teach them to &#8220;blend in&#8221; and &#8220;get by,&#8221; including maintaining successful, brief social interactions.</p>
<p>As a research partner of an $11.7 million <a href="https://gwtoday.gwu.edu/autism-research-targets-transition-young-adulthood" target="_blank">Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) grant</a> from the National Institutes of Health to the George Washington University Autism and Neurodevelopment Disorders Institute, the Center for Autism Spectrum Disorders at Children&#8217;s National will continue investigations into sex differences, and aims to develop self-reporting measures for adolescents and adults that better capture additional populations&#8211;including females and non-cisgender males.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope the ACE studies will help us better understand the diversity of the autism spectrum by allowing us to focus on the ways in which differences in sex and gender identity might influence the expression of autistic traits, thereby enabling us to make more accurate diagnoses,&#8221; Dr. Ratto concludes.</p>
		
		   		
			<h2>Uncovering the Benefits of Fractional Laser Treatments</h2>
			 
		 	<p>In the world of laser skin technology, a time-capsule trip back to the early aughts shows dermatologists at a crossroads: attempts to adjust more invasive approaches were increasingly recognized as failing to bring meaningful improvements. Enter the fractional laser: I think of it as the “Goldilocks’ solution”, offering just the right amount. These lasers can provide the skin restoration that patients want, without the level of downtime or side effects of earlier techniques.”</p>
<p>Fractional lasers stand out due to their design, which purposefully exposes only a portion – or “fraction” – of the patient’s skin to lasers, leaving intermediary areas untouched.</p>
<p>Less really can be more. The fractional approach harnesses our body’s innate healing capability, with untreated areas facilitating faster, more effective skin restoration.</p>
<p>Since their launch in 2004, when the Fraxel®-brand laser was introduced, fractional lasers have exploded, becoming the number-one cosmetic laser skin treatment. More than 400,000 procedures were performed in 2016 alone, according to The American Society of Plastic Surgeons.</p>
<p>Fractional lasers turn back the skin’s clock, so to speak. Laser beams trigger a rapid healing and restoration process. That healing process can eliminate damaged skin – even below the surface – by causing it to be expelled and replaced with new cells.</p>
<p>I offer the following information regarding the unique potential of fractional lasers:</p>
<p><strong>Uncovering 5 Truths About Fractional Laser Skin Treatments</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong> It’s not just an anti-aging treatment: </strong>The ability to replace damaged skin with new growth makes fractional laser treatments an option for different kinds of skin damage. Yes, it can address wrinkles and age spots, but it also can help with other damage, for example scarring due to acne or surgery, as well as with stretch marks.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> It’s compatible with all skin types: </strong>I think it’s helpful for patients to know that their skin type doesn’t make fractional lasers off limits. At this point, we have research that shows these lasers work for different skin tones, as well as for sensitive skin. Of course, regardless of skin type, patients need to carefully follow their doctor’s pre- and post-treatment skin care recommendations to support the best results.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> It’s for more than just the face:</strong> When we consider the different types of skin damage fractional lasers can address. it makes sense that they offer an option for wherever skin restoration in desired – not only on the face.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> It can be customized to meet different patients’ needs: </strong>Since it was introduced, fractional laser technology has continued to evolve. Today, patients can choose from a range of options, from more superficial treatments to those that can address deeper levels of skin damage. Patients can work with their doctors to design an approach that best meets their needs and their lifestyles, in terms of recovery time. The growing range of fractional laser treatments further underscores the importance of carefully choosing a doctor with expertise.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> It can be combined with other treatments:</strong> Increasingly,dermatologists are using different skin treatments together to maximize results. We’re seeing this with fractional lasers, which can be combined with other procedures, for example, with intense pulsed light treatments.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fractional lasers, have brought about what’s been called a “renaissance” in the field of cosmetic skin lasers. As a doctor, it’s extremely rewarding to see what these treatments can do for patients.</p>

			<h2>Hair Loss and Uterine Fibroids</h2>
			 
		 	<p>African-American women with a common pattern of hair loss have an increased chance of developing uterine fibroids, according to new research from Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>The conclusion was based on a study of medical records gathered on hundreds of thousands of African-American women.</p>
<p>In a report on the study, which was published in <em>JAMA Dermatology</em>, the researchers called on physicians who treat women with central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) to make patients aware that they may be at increased risk for fibroids and should be screened for the condition, particularly if they have symptoms such as heavy bleeding and pain.</p>
<p>CCCA predominantly affects black women and is the most common form of permanent alopecia in this population. The excess scar tissue that forms as a result of this type of hair loss may also explain the higher risk for uterine fibroids &#8211; fibrous growths in the lining of the womb.</p>
<p>Crystal Aguh, M.D., assistant professor of dermatology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said the scarring associated with CCCA is similar to the scarring associated with excess fibrous tissue elsewhere in the body, a situation that may explain why women with this type of hair loss are at a higher risk for fibroids.</p>
<p>People of African descent, she noted, are more prone to develop other disorders of abnormal scarring, termed fibroproliferative disorders, such as keloids (a type of raised scar after trauma), scleroderma (an autoimmune disorder marked by thickening of the skin as well as internal organs), some types of lupus and clogged arteries.</p>
<p>During a four-year period from 2013-2017, the researchers analyzed patient data from the Johns Hopkins electronic medical record system (Epic) of 487,104 black women ages 18 and over. The prevalence of those with fibroids was compared in patients with and without CCCA.</p>
<p>Overall, the researchers found that 13.9 percent of women with CCCA also had a history of uterine fibroids compared to only 3.3 percent of black women without the condition. In absolute numbers, out of the 486,000 women who were reviewed, 16,212 had fibroids.</p>
<p>Within that population, 447 had CCCA, of which 62 had fibroids. The findings translate to a fivefold increased risk of uterine fibroids in women with CCCA, compared to age, sex and race matched controls.</p>
<p>Aguh cautioned that the study does not suggest any cause and effect relationship, or prove a common cause for both conditions. “The cause of the link between the two conditions remains unclear,” she said.</p>
<p>However, the association was strong enough, she added, to recommend that physicians and patients be made aware of it.</p>
<p>Women with this type of scarring alopecia should be screened not only for fibroids, but also for other disorders associated with excess fibrous tissue, Aguh said.</p>

			<h2>Accessing Your Own Genomic Data Is a Civil Right</h2>
			 
		 	<p>The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, or GINA, expanded individuals&#8217; access to genetic information by forcing changes to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule. These amendments, finalized in 2013 and 2014, gave Americans a civil right to obtain copies of their own genetic test results stored at HIPAA-regulated laboratories. In a commentary published January 4<sup>TH</sup> 2018 in the <em>American Journal of Human Genetics</em>, Barbara J. Evans, Alumnae College Professor of Law and Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Houston, describes how civil rights and safety concerns collided after these changes and offers strategies to reconcile the two.</p>
<p>A release from the publisher notes that Evan says that GINA celebrates its tenth anniversary this year amid ongoing controversy. &#8220;Scholars poke fun at GINA for &#8216;solving&#8217; a problem that, as far as the evidence shows, never actually existed: genetic discrimination in employment and health insurance. Meanwhile, GINA declined to tackle problems that cause real headaches for people who are about to undergo genetic testing, such as whether the results might make it impossible to buy long-term care insurance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The individual access right GINA created is also a source of heated controversy. Lawmakers foresaw that Americans need a right of access, for example, to protect themselves from being wrongly linked to a crime based on a genetic test mix-up or to help them assess how much hackers stole from a research lab that was storing their genomic data. But GINA created that right by amending the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which left some loose ends.</p>
<p>&#8220;You only have an access right if the party that stores your data happens to be HIPAA-regulated. Most direct-to-consumer testing and cloud data storage services are not HIPAA-regulated, so you may not have an access right if your data are there, says Evans. Also, the new access right was not successfully integrated with other regulations. &#8220;You have one regulator telling research labs to provide access, to protect civil rights. Other regulators try to block access, citing safety concerns. Labs are caught in the middle and many Americans are being deprived of a federally protected civil right to see their data.&#8221;</p>
<p>The source of the dispute is that many research laboratories are HIPAA regulated and subject to the new access right. Giving people access to data from research laboratories is controversial because the genomic data they produce do not always contain clinically relevant information (only about 200 gene sequences have known clinical significance). Someone could misinterpret the data to pursue needless medical treatment or waste healthcare resources to clarify findings that they misunderstand.</p>
<p>Because of concerns that research data could be misused, bioethicists and medical professionals, as well as safety regulators like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which regulates clinical labs, at times, have taken stances that cause research labs to block people&#8217;s new access right. &#8220;The good news is that we aren&#8217;t forced to choose between having safety or having civil rights,&#8221; Evans adds, &#8220;We can have both, but it requires regulators to be smart and think outside their usual boxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her commentary, Evans says that safety regulators have many tools to address safety risks without blocking access, such as requiring warnings and disclosures and sending informational letters to physicians. She also recommends publishing reliability scores for organizations that provide genomic interpretation services. Congress may also need to authorize funds to help research laboratories deal with the cost of providing access after research grants end.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having access to your own genomic data also lets you exercise important constitutional rights, such as your First Amendment rights to assemble and petition the government. You can go on social media and assemble groups of people with genes like yours and lobby Congress to spend more research dollars studying how those genes affect your health,&#8221; says Evans. &#8220;Like the right to vote, access to one&#8217;s own genomic data is a foundational civil right that empowers people to protect all their other civil rights.&#8221;</p>

			<h2>When Cancer Comes Back</h2>
			 
		 	<p><em>From the National Cancer Institute, information every cancer survivor should know:</em></p>
<p>When cancer comes back after treatment, doctors call it a recurrence or recurrent cancer. Finding out that cancer has come back can cause feelings of shock, anger, sadness, and fear. But you have something now that you didn’t have before—experience. You’ve lived through cancer already and you know what to expect. Also, remember that treatments may have improved since you were first diagnosed. New drugs or methods may help with your treatment or in managing side effects. In some cases, improved treatments have helped turn cancer into a chronic disease that people can manage for many years.</p>
<p>Recurrent cancer starts with cancer cells that the first treatment didn’t fully remove or destroy. This doesn’t mean that the treatment you received was wrong. It just means that a small number of cancer cells survived the treatment and were too small to show up in follow-up tests. Over time, these cells grew into tumors or cancer that your doctor can now detect.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a new type of cancer will occur in people who have a history of cancer. When this happens, the new cancer is known as a second primary cancer. Second primary cancer is different from recurrent cancer.</p>
<p>Types of Recurrent Cancer</p>
<p>Doctors describe recurrent cancer by where it develops and how far it has spread. The different types of recurrence are:
<ul>
<li>Local recurrence means that the cancer is in the same place as the original cancer or very close to it.</li>
<li>Regional recurrence means that the tumor has grown into lymph nodes or tissues near the original cancer.</li>
<li>Distant recurrence means the cancer has spread to organs or tissues far from the original cancer. When cancer spreads to a distant place in the body, it is called metastasis or metastatic cancer. When cancer spreads, it is still the same type of cancer. For example, if you had colon cancer, it may come back in your liver. But the cancer is still called colon cancer.</li>
</ul>
<p>To figure out the type of recurrence you have, you will undergo many of the same tests you had when your cancer was first diagnosed, such as lab tests and imaging procedures. These tests help determine where the cancer has returned in your body, if it has spread, and how far. Your doctor may refer to this new assessment of your cancer as “restaging.”</p>
<p>After these tests, the doctor may assign a new stage to the cancer. An “r” will be added to the beginning of the new stage to reflect the restaging. The original stage at diagnosis does not change.</p>
<p>See our information on <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/diagnosis" target="_blank">Diagnosis</a> to learn more about the tests that may be used to assess recurrent cancer.</p>
<p>The type of treatment that you have for recurrent cancer will depend on your type of cancer and how far it has spread.

			<h2>Blueberry Extract Shows Promise in Treating Cervical Cancer</h2>
			 
		 	<p>When treating cervical cancer, the effectiveness of radiation can be increased with the use of blueberry extract, new research shows.</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 12,000 women in the United States are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year. One of the most common treatments for cervical cancer is radiation. While radiation therapy destroys cancer cells, it also destroys nearby healthy cells.</p>
<p>University of Missouri School of Medicine researchers studied in vitro human cancer cells to show that combining blueberry extract with radiation can help radiation treatments be more successful. Their study was published in <em>Pathology and Oncology Magazine</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays and other particles such as gamma rays to destroy cancer cells,&#8221; said Yujiang Fang, M.D., Ph.D., a visiting professor at the MU School of Medicine and lead author of the study. &#8220;For some cancers, such as late-stage cervical cancer, radiation is a good treatment option. However, collateral damage to healthy cells always occurs. Based on previous research, we studied blueberry extract to verify it could be used as a radiosensitizer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Radiosensitizers are non-toxic chemicals that make cancer cells more responsive to radiation therapy. In a previous study, Fang and his research team showed that resveratrol, a compound in red grapes, could be used as a radiosensitizer for treating prostate cancer. Blueberries also contain resveratrol.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to resveratrol, blueberries also contain flavonoids,&#8221; said Fang, who also has appointments as an academic pathologist and assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Des Moines University in Iowa. &#8220;Flavonoids are chemicals that may have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers used human cervical cancer cell lines to mimic clinical treatment. The cell lines were divided into four groups that included a control group, a group that received only radiation, a group that received only blueberry extract, and a group that received both radiation and the extract.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our team used three different measures to confirm results of the study,&#8221; Fang said. &#8220;Radiation decreased cancer cells by approximately 20 percent. Interestingly, the cell group that received only blueberry extract had a 25 percent decrease in cancer. However, the biggest decline in cancer cells occurred in the radiation and extract group, with a decrease of about 70 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fang explained that the mechanism that makes blueberry extract a radiosensitizer also reduces the abnormal explosion of cell growth that defines cancer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cancer cells avoid death by remodeling themselves,&#8221; Fang said. &#8220;Along with reducing cell proliferation, the extract also &#8216;tricks&#8217; cancer cells into dying. So it inhibits the birth and promotes the death of cancer cells.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fang said an animal study is the next step to confirm that his team can achieve the same results.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blueberries are very common and found all over the world,&#8221; Fang said. &#8220;They are readily accessible and inexpensive. As a natural treatment option for boosting the effectiveness of existing therapies, I feel they would be enthusiastically accepted.&#8221;</p>
		
		   		
			<h2>Elder Financial Abuse: Signs and Prevention</h2>
			 
		 	<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, there are over 40 million people 65 or older in the U.S. Unfortunately, this demographic, especially those with dementia and cognitive impairment, is left especially vulnerable to financial abuse. Almost three billion dollars is wrongfully taken from older adults annually, a number that continues to grow as Americans are now living longer. Such abuse leads to devastating physical, mental, and emotional consequences; elders who fall victim to financial exploitation are three times more likely to die earlier.</p>
<p>To help protect your loved ones from mistreatment, attorney Michael Hackard, author of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/099914460X/ref=rdr_ext_tmb" target="_blank">The Wolf at the Door</a></em>, explains five common types of senior financial abuse, as well as ways to prevent them.</p>
<p><strong>Misappropriation of income</strong></p>
<p>Signs of financial fraud can range from unusual and secretive bank activity, the addition of a stranger’s name to an account, or something as subtle as the senior never knowing where his/her checkbook is kept. “This is why an elder should always share important financial information with a trusted family member,” Hackard says.</p>
<p><strong>Improper actions by an attorney</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are cases when attorneys wrongfully deny elders information and access to their financials, put them on very small allowances, and even transfer assets, all done in secrecy. If your loved one has an attorney and is in distress believing he/she has no money, Hackard urges you to establish transparency and team up with all trusted helpers (children, grandchildren, other relatives) to get a better understanding of the situation and take action if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Undue influence</strong></p>
<p>There are various factors in determining whether unfair influential abuse has taken place: whether the influencer knew (or should have known) about the victim’s incapacity or dependency; the influencer’s apparent authority over the elder (fiduciary, care provider, legal professional); and the influencer’s conduct (controlling meds, using coercion, initiating changes in personal or property rights). Prevent this type of wrongdoing by establishing an open-book policy with the elders in your life. “Communication is critical, because isolation and loneliness are tinder for financial abuse,” says Hackard.</p>
<p><strong>Investment fraud</strong></p>
<p>If your loved one has withdrawn money from the bank to pay for a service charge related to winning a sweepstakes or investing in a high interest loan, he/she is likely to have been tricked. High- pressure sales can be especially persuasive when the victim is physically and mentally vulnerable. Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it is. “The payment of thousands of dollars to get millions, investing in a note with 30% interest, and the promise of doubling your money in an investment scheme, are warnings of wrongdoing and ultimate loss,” Hackard says.</p>
<p><strong>Repair scams</strong></p>
<p>From $300 weekly lawn mowing charges to transfers of property (even houses) for “safekeeping”, these are real ways that crooks can exploit the elderly with false repair schemes—especially if the elder is already dealing with another problem. To protect a love one from such wrongdoing, Hackard says your vigilance is key: “Get information from the elder, keep your eyes out for potentially false repair invoices, and always keep good communications line open.”</p>
		
		   		
			<h2>Junk food Tax Is Legally and Administratively Viable</h2>
			 
		 	<p>An original analysis by researchers at New York University College of Global Public Health and the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University finds that a federal tax on junk food is both legally and administratively feasible.</p>
<p>The article, published online in January 2018 in the <em>American Journal of Public Health</em>, points to using an excise tax paid by junk food manufacturers, rather than a sales tax for consumers.</p>
<p>A release from the university quotes Jennifer L. Pomeranz, JD, MPH, assistant professor of public health policy and management at NYU College of Global Public Health and the article&#8217;s lead author, as saying, &#8220;Economic and social environments can influence food choice in beneficial and harmful directions. Our finding that a federal manufacturer excise junk food tax &#8211; defined through product category or combined category-nutrient approaches &#8211; appears to be legally and administratively feasible and has strong implications for nutrition policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unhealthy eating is a leading risk factor for obesity and other life-threatening diseases, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. One strategy governments use to improve diet is creating policies that change the price of food and beverages, either through taxing unhealthy foods or offering subsidies for healthier foods.</p>
<p>While local taxes on soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages are rapidly growing in popularity and political acceptance, the idea of a national soda or junk food tax &#8211; which would have far broader effects than local taxes &#8211; has not yet gained political traction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Junk food taxes have the potential to substantially reduce the disease burden that results from unhealthy food and beverage consumption in the United States,&#8221; said Renata Micha, RD, PhD, associate research professor at the Friedman School at Tufts and one of the study&#8217;s senior authors.</p>
<p>Key policy questions include how foods to be taxed would be defined and what the appropriate taxing mechanism would be. In order to address these gaps in knowledge, the NYU and Tufts research team evaluated the scientific literature, recent legislative experiences from the U.S. and other countries on defining targeted foods, U.S. federal taxing and administrative mechanisms, and potential differences by tax purpose and type.</p>
<p>To assess how food could be defined in a federal tax, they examined the scientific literature for recommendations on defining targeted products for junk food taxes, as well as existing U.S. and international legislation. The researchers identified four methods of classifying foods: by product category (such as soda or candy), broad nutrient criteria, specific nutrients or calories, or a combination. Some of the research also recommended a graduated taxation strategy, where the tax increases as the nutritional quality of the food decreases (for instance, as the sugar content increases, the tax increases).</p>
<p>Similarly, local U.S. junk food tax bills and laws, international junk food laws, and U.S. soda taxes supported taxing foods using category-based, nutrient-based, or combination approaches. The most frequently targeted categories were sugar-sweetened beverages, candy, processed meat products, and sweet and salty snacks, and the most frequently targeted nutrients were sugar, calories, and salt. No legislation used a broad nutrition criteria approach alone, targeted single nutrients other than sugar alone, or taxed foods by level of processing.</p>
<p>Looking at the U.S. federal taxing mechanisms and the tax code, they sought to determine which type of tax &#8211; sales or excise &#8211; would be the most administratively feasible. Excise taxes are generally charged on the manufacture, distribution, or sale of commodities; revenue can be earmarked for a specific purpose, and the taxed entity determines the extent to which it will pass on the tax to consumers. Sales taxes are paid by consumers and collected by sellers to remit to the taxing authority. The U.S. federal government does not have sales taxes, but it does administer dozens of manufacturer excise taxes.</p>
<p>The researchers found that U.S. food tax bills and laws with a nutritional purpose and junk food taxes in Hungary and Mexico overwhelmingly use an excise tax mechanism. In addition, U.S. manufacturer excise taxes on alcohol &#8211; which are based on ingredient levels and processing, and in the case of wine, increase along with the amount of alcohol in the product &#8211; offer an informative model that could be adopted for junk food taxes.</p>
<p>From legal and administrative perspectives, the researchers conclude that a federal junk food tax appears feasible. The scientific literature and existing bills and laws support defining junk food through product-specific categories, or a combination of product-specific categories and nutrients, with additional support for a graduated taxation strategy where the tax increases as the nutritional quality of the food decreases. Administratively, federal taxes and taxing mechanisms support the viability of a junk food excise tax paid by food manufacturers.</p>
<p>&#8220;One advantage of a manufacturer excise tax is that food companies may be incentivized to reformulate their products if nutrition criteria are incorporated into the tax,&#8221; Pomeranz said.</p>

			<h2>How to Make New Year’s Resolutions and Make Them Stick</h2>
			 
		 	<p>Every year we begin a new year resolving to do (or quit doing) something and expect to be the game changer in our lives. For some it’s to workout, lose weight, cut out all carbs and sweets. For others, it’s a promise to save more money and get finances on track. Regardless of what you resolve to do there is a way to set yourself up for failure or success. The mindset we are in when deciding on a resolution determines it&#8217;s stickiness. Here are my key insights on how to make New Year’s Resolutions that stick.
<ol>
<li><strong><em> Envision the end result and reverse engineer it.</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Neural pathways in the brain can be changed through a combination of visualization and aligned action. She encourages people to journal about what it is they want. Write it all out. “How would life improve? What would all the benefits be? Cut pictures out of magazines of what you want and post them to a wall (or if appropriate, the refrigerator). Get very clear on what you think you will feel like once you see results.
<ol start="2">
<li><strong><em> Get clear on your triggers.</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Set yourself up for success by understanding what may potentially get you off track. Sticky resolutions come with planning. If you want to lose weight then begin with clearing out your fridge and cupboards of junk food. That in itself is an action that will tell your brain that you are serious. Get recipes and write out a new grocery shopping list. Writing plans, micro goals and ideas that serve the greater accomplishment you&#8217;re reaching for creates “buy in” from your brain.</p>
<p>For the people resolving to save more money, evaluate when and why you spend. If you notice you spend $40 a week on coffee, think of alternatives. You don’t want to cut yourself off from anything cold-turkey. The brain doesn’t respond well to deprivation. It sends brain chemicals that signal displeasure which is what makes resolutions lose their stickiness. Shift to a possibility or curiosity mindset. Asking yourself, what can I do to save $5 per day invites in inspired thoughts and creative ideas.
<ol start="3">
<li><strong><em> Pace yourself.</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The reason why resolutions don’t stick is because people set the bar way too high and expect achievement way too fast. Think of every week as a win! Break it down into weekly chunks and train the brain to value quick accomplishments. The people who resolve to lose weight and get more exercise won’t stick to it if they don’t celebrate small milestones and try to do too much too soon. Resolve to lose 1 to 3 pounds per week. Do this by cutting out soft drinks or juices and drinking water instead. After 10 weeks you&#8221;ll be 20 pounds lighter with great skin just because you did one thing week by week until it became your new normal.
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Trick your brain by making it fun.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Our language and self-talk is everything and determines if our resolution will fade or will become something we’re still doing in June. When someone resolves to change their diet, exercise and lose weight they already envision how difficult it is going to be so they are already dreading it before they started. However, shifting the brain to doing something fun that is in line with the goal gets you more committed. Create a playlist of great music to work out to. Look up recipes on Pinterest to build your new shopping list. When you do the advance preparation that is more fun, and take small steps towards building the new lifestyle to support your resolution, you’re setting yourself up for a win.
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Fuel your resolution with greater purpose worth committing to.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to resolve to save more money, it’s helpful to have a clear purpose for the money you plan to save. Resolving to save more money is vague making it hard to remain on track. Saving more money to take an amazing vacation or to purchase a home or car is something tangible you can stick to. “It’s common for people to commit to doing something when they connect it to a greater purpose beyond them or an experience they want to have. This explains why lifetime smokers can instantly quit when they learn they are pregnant. It’s not about them anymore. We see the man who is 75 pounds overweight lose weight when his daughter gets engaged. Whenever we can connect resolutions to a bigger purpose our minds get on board, and when the mind is all in, resolutions stick.</p>

			<h2>Ophthalmologists and Electronic Health Records</h2>
			 
		 	<p>Although ophthalmologists&#8217; use of electronic health records (EHR) systems for storing and accessing patients&#8217; medical histories more than doubled between 2006 and 2016, their perceptions of financial and clinical productivity following EHR implementation declined, according to new research.</p>
<p>The study was published in <em>JAMA Ophthalmology</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our findings highlight the fact that companies that design EHR systems should further address the efficiency and usability of those systems,&#8221; said lead author Michele C. Lim, vice chair and medical director of the University of California Davis Eye Center.</p>
<p>The findings were based on a series of three questionnaires. The most recent survey, conducted from 2015 to 2016, was emailed to 2,000 randomly selected members of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. A total of 348 (17.4 percent) ophthalmologists responded. Similar surveys were conducted in 2011 (492 respondents, or 33 percent) and 2006 (592 respondents, or 15.6 percent).</p>
<p>Among respondents to the latest survey, 72.1 percent had implemented EHR, more than triple the rate of 10 years earlier (19 percent). Ophthalmology practices linked with integrated, government or university health systems were more likely to have adopted EHR.</p>
<p>Respondents who converted from paper to electronic record-keeping also were asked about productivity changes based on the number of patients they see each day. Only about 15 percent responded in 2006 that productivity decreased as a result of EHR adoption, but by 2016 more than half did. Similarly, respondents were asked how EHR affected overall practice costs: About 13 percent in 2006 felt that it resulted in increased costs, compared to 75 percent in the most recent survey.</p>
<p>&#8220;The surveys reveal deepening dissatisfaction with utilizing EHR,&#8221; Lim said. &#8220;Despite their dissatisfaction, however, only one-third of ophthalmologists surveyed said that they would return to paper records if they could, and more than half said they would not.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) established incentives in 2011 to encourage hospitals and clinics to adopt and demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology. At first, financial rewards were given for EHR adoption. More recently, financial penalties have been levied for non-compliance with EHR use.</p>
<p>According to survey results, qualifying for CMS incentives was deemed cumbersome and too costly by many providers.</p>
<p>The authors pointed out that their study was limited by small sample sizes and the possibility of bias if more dissatisfied ophthalmologists responded to the two recent surveys or, conversely, if more satisfied ophthalmologists responded to the first survey. In addition, the surveys only asked about perceptions, and the researchers did not validate reported financial or clinical productivity changes.</p>
<p>Conducting three surveys over time likely lessened these limitations though, according to Lim. She is planning a future survey focused on the effects of using medical scribes (paraprofessionals who chronicle physican/patient appointments as they are happening) to aid doctors in using EHR more efficiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a perfect world, EHR systems would help providers deliver efficient patient care and include a positive, user-friendly interface,&#8221; Lim said. &#8220;EHR technology is evolving, and we will end up with such systems if appropriate stakeholders, including health care professionals who use EHR, and those who design them work together.&#8221;</p>
		
		   		
			<h2>Neighborhood Factors May Predict Heart Failure</h2>
			 
		 	<p>Neighborhood-level socioeconomic factors in low-income areas may significantly predict heart failure risk beyond individual health factors and socioeconomic status, according to new research in <em>Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes</em>, an American Heart Association journal.</p>
<p>According to this news release from the AHA, the study compared census tract data on socioeconomic deprivation – a clustering of neighborhood-level variables of wealth, education, occupation and housing patterns – and heart failure rates among 27,078 middle-aged whites and African-Americans from the Southeastern states.</p>
<p>Researchers grouped the participants (average age 55, 69 percent African-American, 63 percent women) in three groups ranging from the least-deprived to the most-deprived neighborhoods. During an average follow-up of more than five years, 4,300 participants were diagnosed with heart failure.</p>
<p>Researchers noted that residents living in more socioeconomically deprived areas were at the highest risk for heart failure. As neighborhood socioeconomic factors worsened between one group to the next, researchers noted a 12 percent increase in risk of heart failure. After adjusting for other factors, researchers say 4.8 percent of the variance in heart-failure risk was explained by neighborhood factors.</p>
<p>“There is existing evidence suggesting strong, independent associations between personal socioeconomic status – like education, income level and occupation – and risks of heart failure and many other chronic diseases,” said Loren Lipworth, Sc.D., the study’s co-senior author and associate professor of epidemiology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
<p>“But what this study adds is evidence suggesting that characteristics of your place of residence, actually also play a significant role in influencing the risk of heart failure over and above the role of your own individual socioeconomic characteristics,” she said. “It opens the door for possible interventions that center on preventive measures in the community.”</p>
<p>Study participants were from the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) – an ongoing prospective investigation of cancer and other chronic conditions in a largely resource-limited, underinsured group of recruits in 12 Southeastern states.</p>
<p>Heart failure is a major public health problem, particularly in the southeastern United States, which has the highest prevalence of established heart-failure risk factors, including coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity.</p>
<p>More than 50 percent of the participants studied lived in the most deprived neighborhoods. Seventy percent of residents studied earned less than $15,000 a year. Nearly 39 percent had less than a high-school education and 44 percent were obese.</p>
<p>Researchers suggest residents may benefit most from improvements in community resources such as exercise facilities, healthy food outlets and medical facilities.</p>
<p>“Increased and improved access to community-level resources could mitigate cardiovascular disease risk factors like obesity, hypertension and diabetes,” said Elvis Akwo, M.D., Ph.D., first author of the study and a postdoctoral research fellow at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “Improved community-level resources may ultimately reduce the risk of heart failure in these communities.”</p>
<p>The American Heart Association and other organizations recognize that improvements in cardiovascular health requires strategies that target the entire spectrum of health and wellness, including public policy changes, prevention efforts and treatment. The focus on public policy and prevention may have the greatest potential to mitigate the burden of cardiovascular disease and improve overall health, researchers said.</p>
<p>An accompanying editorial by Wayne Rosamond Ph.D.; M.S. and Anna Johnson, Ph.D.; MSPH, said this research adds an important aspect to our understanding of the role of neighborhood in health by focusing on low-income neighborhoods.</p>
<p>“By conducting this study in a predominantly low socioeconomic status (SES) population, the potential for bias from individual SES is reduced, allowing for a direct interpretation of associations of neighborhood aspects with heart failure incidence,” Rosasmond and Johnson wrote.</p>
<p>“The careful and unique population prospective cohort approach taken by Akwo and colleagues further establishes that there indeed is something unique about neighborhoods.”</p>
<p>However, the study’s focus primarily on low-income, middle-aged adults limits it from being generalized to other groups. But researchers believe the emphasis on this population – now and in the future – provides much-needed research attention on a segment of people who have been underrepresented in previous cardiovascular studies.</p>

			<h2>NIH Discovery Brings Stem Cell Therapy for Dry AMD Closer to the Clinic</h2>
			 
		 	<p>Scientists at the National Eye Institute (NEI), part of the National Institutes of Health, report that tiny tube-like protrusions called primary cilia on cells of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) &#8212; a layer of cells in the back of the eye &#8212; are essential for the survival of the retina&#8217;s light-sensing photoreceptors. The discovery has advanced efforts to make stem cell-derived RPE for transplantation into patients with geographic atrophy, otherwise known as dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness in the U.S. The study appears in the January 2<sup>nd</sup> 2018 <em>Cell Reports</em>.</p>
<p>A release from NIH quotes the study&#8217;s lead investigator, Kapil Bharti, Ph.D., Stadtman investigator at the NEI, as saying, &#8220;We now have a better idea about how to generate and replace RPE cells, which appear to be among the first type of cells to stop working properly in AMD.” Bharti is leading the development of patient stem cell-derived RPE for an AMD clinical trial set to launch in 2018.</p>
<p>In a healthy eye, RPE cells nourish and support photoreceptors, the cells that convert light into electrical signals that travel to the brain via the optic nerve. RPE cells form a layer just behind the photoreceptors. In geographic atrophy, RPE cells die, which causes photoreceptors to degenerate, leading to vision loss.</p>
<p>Bharti and his colleagues are hoping to halt and reverse the progression of geographic atrophy by replacing diseased RPE with lab-made RPE. The approach involves using a patient&#8217;s blood cells to generate induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), cells capable of becoming any type of cell in the body. iPSCs are grown in the laboratory and then coaxed into becoming RPE for surgical implantation.</p>
<p>Attempts to create functional RPE implants, however, have hit a recurring obstacle: iPSCs programmed to become RPE cells have a tendency to get developmentally stuck, said Bharti. &#8220;The cells frequently fail to mature into functional RPE capable of supporting photoreceptors. In cases where they do mature, however, RPE maturation coincides with the emergence of primary cilia on the iPSC-RPE cells.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers tested three drugs known to modulate the growth of primary cilia on iPSC-derived RPE. As predicted, the two drugs known to enhance cilia growth significantly improved the structural and functional maturation of the iPSC-derived RPE. One important characteristic of maturity observed was that the RPE cells all oriented properly, correctly forming a single, functional monolayer. The iPSC-derived RPE cell gene expression profile also resembled that of adult RPE cells. And importantly, the cells performed a crucial function of mature RPE cells: they engulfed the tips of photoreceptor outer segments, a pruning process that keeps photoreceptors working properly.</p>
<p>By contrast, iPSC-derived RPE cells exposed to the third drug, an inhibitor of cilia growth, demonstrated severely disrupted structure and functionality.</p>
<p>As further confirmation of their observations, when the researchers genetically knocked down expression of cilia protein IFT88, the iPSC-derived RPE showed severe maturation and functional defects, as confirmed by gene expression analysis. Tissue staining showed that knocking down IFT88 led to reduced iPSC-derived RPE cell density and functional polarity, i.e., cells within the RPE tissue pointed in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Bharti and his group found similar results in iPSC-derived lung cells, another type of epithelial cell with primary cilia. When iPSC-derived lung cells were exposed to drugs that enhance cilia growth, immunostaining confirmed that the cells looked structurally mature.</p>
<p>The report suggests that primary cilia regulate the suppression of the canonical WNT pathway, a cell signaling pathway involved in embryonic development. Suppression of the WNT pathway during RPE development instructs the cells to stop dividing and to begin differentiating into adult RPE, according to the researchers.</p>
<p>The researchers also generated iPSC-derived RPE from a patient with ciliopathy, a disorder that causes severe vision loss due to photoreceptor degeneration. The patient&#8217;s ciliopathy was associated with mutations of cilia gene CEP290. Compared to a healthy donor, iPSC-derived RPE from the ciliopathy patient had cilia that were smaller. The patient&#8217;s iPSC-derived RPE also had maturation and functional defects similar to those with IFT88 knockdown.</p>
<p>Further studies in a mouse model of ciliopathy confirmed an important temporal relationship: Looking across several early development stages, the RPE defects preceded the photoreceptor degeneration, which provides additional insights into ciliopathy-induced retinal degeneration.</p>
<p>The study&#8217;s findings have been incorporated into the group&#8217;s protocol for making clinical-grade iPSC-derived RPE. They will also inform the development of disease models for research of AMD and other degenerative retinal diseases, Bharti said.</p>

			<h2>Knowing About “Drunkorexia” Can Save Your Child’s Life</h2>
			 
		 	<p>I learned about “drunkorexia” the hard way the other night when a “very close family member” called me, asking for a ride home after he was arrested for driving under the influence. He was heading home after a night out with friends and was “pulled over” by the police.</p>
<p>He is normally a responsible, level-headed individual who has both Uber and Lyft apps on his phone. He could have easily accessed either app, if he knew he would be in a situation where he might have a few drinks and had to get home. He had never had this experience before, so I wondered why this happened.</p>
<p>It turns out he had put himself on a very strenuous workout regimen and crash diet to lose some weight he gained after a sports injury. When he knew he had to go out with friends, he usually skipped dinner and sometimes lunch. He then drank alcohol thinking he could afford the calories from it, since he was consuming so few of them from food and was exercising so much.</p>
<p>Of course, drinking on an empty stomach is never a good idea and even less so when your body needs to recuperate after exercise. This risky combination resulted in him “miscalculating” how much he was drinking and how it would affect him. And the result was a DUI.</p>
<p>He’s now following a program to lose weight in a healthy way and also address his drinking patterns. I am glad to say he is doing well on both.</p>
<p>As someone who has dedicated her life to helping people get and stay healthy, I decided to see if what happened to my “very close family member” is happening to other college students and, if so, how common the combination of drinking and extreme dieting is.</p>
<p>What I found out is alarming and something every parent with a child in college needs to know.</p>
<p><strong>It’s More Common Than You Think.</strong></p>
<p>I learned that what happened to my family member is now commonplace on campuses around the country. So common, in fact, that it has a slang name – <em>drunkorexia</em> – and<u> </u>more than 80 percent of college students, both male and female, who binge drink report doing it.</p>
<p>The term <em>drunkorexia</em> pretty much means exactly what it sounds like: being drunk and anorexic at the same time. If you “Google” <em>drunkorexia</em>, the option to look up “<em>drunkorexia</em> tips” will auto populate in the search box.</p>
<p>How disturbing!</p>
<p>While not a medical term, it refers to combining alcohol consumption with extreme and risky diet-related behaviors such as limiting food intake (including skipping meals), excessive exercising or, in more extreme cases, binging and purging (which is a behavior of bulimia). This behavior may also involve taking laxatives and diuretics.</p>
<p>The idea behind <em>drunkorexia</em> is to limit the number of calories from food, so that you can drink more without gaining weight. Some students also report doing it, since drinking on an empty stomach gets them drunk faster and for less money.</p>
<p>A study by the University of Missouri found that 30% of female college students admitted that within the last year they had restricted food, in order to consume greater quantities of alcohol. The same study found that men are more likely to engage in similar behavior, in order to save money for purchasing alcohol. According to the study, 67% of students who restrict calories prior to alcoholic beverage consumption do so to prevent <u>weight gain</u>, while 21% did so to facilitate alcohol intoxication.</p>
<p>No matter the reason(s) for engaging in this behavior, it is very risky socially, psychologically and physically.</p>
<p>While some students may exhibit <em>drunkorexia</em> on an ad hoc or binge basis, others plan their dieting and exercise around their drinking events to try and maximize the perceived benefits.</p>
<p>In <u>one report</u> a student said, “Me getting drunk faster from starving myself, that was just a bonus point.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another told researchers, “Nobody told me about [drunkorexia]. I just, like, figured it out. I got it down to a science. If it&#8217;s greasy food, it&#8217;ll soak up. You can drink so much if you eat cheeseburgers.”</p>
<p>Of course, a diet of fasting and cheeseburgers is risky enough without the addition of large quantities of alcohol to the mix.</p>
<p>The jury is still out on whether <em>drunkorexia</em> is more of an eating disorder or more of an alcohol abuse issue. I personally think it is both.</p>
<p>One thing that researchers seem to agree on, however, is that students who engage in <em>drunkorexia</em> are seldom, if ever, anorexic. This is because any student battling this eating disorder would tend to avoid alcohol completely due to its high caloric content.</p>
<p><strong>Life-and-Death Risks</strong></p>
<p>No matter the motivation behind it – to save calories, get drunk faster or a combination of both – <em>drunkorexia</em> creates both short-term and long-term risks to students. These include:
<ul>
<li>Dehydration</li>
<li>Vitamin and mineral depletion, especially B vitamins</li>
<li>Chronic malnutrition</li>
<li>Alcohol poisoning</li>
<li>Blackouts, which may lead to risky behaviors like driving under the influence and unprotected sex. It also may make someone more of a target for a sexual assault.</li>
<li>Alcohol-related brain damage, high blood pressure, heart disease</li>
<li>Reduced cognitive abilities, e.g., difficulty concentrating, trouble studying or making decisions</li>
<li>Poor academic performance</li>
<li>Increased probability of substance abuse and chronic disease in later life</li>
<li>Social problems, e.g., fights, violence, dysfunctional relationships</li>
<li>Legal problems</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Can You Be Proactive About <em>Drunkorexia</em>?</strong></p>
<p>Since the vast majority of college students live on-campus, as a parent it may be difficult to readily spot the warning signs of <em>drunkorexia</em> in your child. But things you can watch for (either alone or in combination) include the following:
<ul>
<li>Changes in physical activity, especially an unexplained increase from previous levels or over exercising for no apparent reason.</li>
<li>A new preoccupation or concern over calorie intake, especially if your child has a normal body weight.</li>
<li>Missing or skipping meals your child used to always enjoy and/or consume, for no apparent reason.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Drunkorexia</em> is not yet a medically diagnosed condition, and there is no specific treatment for it. However since it is a combination of two different disorders, any type of intervention or treatment will need to address both. If your child shares that he or she is concerned they may be suffering from <em>drunkorexia</em>, there are ways to help them:
<ul>
<li>Encourage them to seek support from their university health services. Many universities are now recognizing <em>drunkorexia</em> as a problem and offering support.</li>
<li>Encourage them to exercise, but in a healthy manner that does not involve overdoing it simply to burn as many calories as possible. Exercise can help relieve stress and be good for mental health. And of course, it benefits the heart and helps with weight management.</li>
<li>Identify local support groups, especially 12-step groups, that address eating disorders, alcohol abuse and self-image doubts and share these with your child.</li>
<li>Help your child learn more about healthy eating and healthy living habits that can help undo the health damage <em>drunkorexia</em> can cause and to stay healthier overall. There is a wealth of information here at <a href="http://www.phlabs.com/health-info" target="_blank"><u>pH Labs</u> </a>that they can use.</li>
<li>Consider getting nutritional testing for your child to see what impact their eating and drinking behaviors may have had on their bodies. Identify the steps they can take to remedy any deficiencies and get nutrients such as water, healthy fats, vitamins and minerals back in their bodies for a healthy balance.</li>
</ul>
<p>College has always been and always should be a time for self-discovery, exploration and learning about oneself and the world. It also involves experimenting and learning limits. The secret is doing so in moderation. With a little common sense and education, your child will be able to recognize that <em>drunkorexia</em> goes over the limit.</p>
<p>And by the way, that “very close family member” has agreed to relay his experiences with losing weight and drinking after he has completed his program. That is the price he had to pay for depriving me of much needed sleep. Stay tuned!</p>
